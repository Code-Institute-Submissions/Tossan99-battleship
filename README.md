## Intoduction
Tossans battleship game is a Python terminal game. It runs on a mock terminal deployed to Heroku. 

It is based on the classic board game “battleships”. A guessing game for two players that is played on ruled grids on which each player place their ships on. The locations of the ships are concealed for the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
